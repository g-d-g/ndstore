These scripts were used to process the source images from Davi Boch and Clay Reid.
This code was thrown together quickly to "get the job done", but may be of use
for others facing a similar task.

All scripts were run using the Enthought Python Distribution (www.enthought.com),
but any standard distribution with the Python Image Library (PIL) 1.1.7 or newer
should work.
