In order to use this software, follow these steps:
 
 * uAlex script
 * MySQL/Cassandra
 * nginx
 * KL TODO
 
*This tool uses ITK-Snap for annotating, and MANNO+CAJAL to pull and push data appropriately.  It is not necessary for all annotators to use MATLAB and CAJAL, as long as they have a mechanism (such as a grad student) to help pull and push data.  Annotators only need to be able to load, annotate, and save within ITK Snap.*
