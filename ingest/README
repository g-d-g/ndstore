This directory now contains ingest routines for:

  kasthuri annotations
  catmaid tile stacks

Maybe they should be split.  

Notes for tile ingest:


This is just legacy software for image ingest.  The annotation and cutout service 
have been merged.  This should get moved to an ingest directory.

Software to ingest data and to run the EM Open Connectom cutout interface.  Instructions for how to use the interface are at:

The entry points is:

  gendb.py -- generate a cutout database from a set of tiles

For either to work, MySQL and a set of DB configurations files must be created.
  
  Instructions:  TODO -- for now, email randal@cs.jhu.edu


Notes for kasthuri ingest:

The files in this directory converted the exported PNG files from VAST into an annotation database.  Data only.

*** denseingest.py -- dense ingest for old versions of VAST data that export data as 4 8192x8192 .png files

*** denseingest2.py -- updated version of the dense ingest process for the Bobby's annotations that 
            represent data in a single .png file.
