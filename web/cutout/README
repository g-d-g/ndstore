Software to ingest data and to run the EM Open Connectom cutout interface.  Instructions for how to use the interface are at:

http://hssl.cs.jhu.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=randal:hssl:research:brain:data_set_description&s[]=cutout

The two entry points are:

  gendb.py -- generate a cutout database from a set of tiles

  brainweb.py -- the Web.py RESTful Web services interface.

For either to work, MySQL and a set of DB configurations files must be created.
  
  Instructions:  TODO -- for now, email randal@cs.jhu.edu
