This is just legacy software for image ingest.  The annotation and cutout service 
have been merged.  This should get moved to an ingest directory.

Software to ingest data and to run the EM Open Connectom cutout interface.  Instructions for how to use the interface are at:

The entry points is:

  gendb.py -- generate a cutout database from a set of tiles

For either to work, MySQL and a set of DB configurations files must be created.
  
  Instructions:  TODO -- for now, email randal@cs.jhu.edu
